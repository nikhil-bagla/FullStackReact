1) Dynamic Port Binding:

Heroku tells us which port our app will use,so we need to make
sure we listen to the port they tell us to

Setting up environment variable
Syntax:
const PORT=process.env.PORT || 5000;  //for heroku to inject port number when app is executed by heroku
app.listen(PORT); 

2) Specify Node environment

We want to use a specific version of node,so we
need to tell Heroku which version we want.

Syntax:
//Insert in package.json just after "main" :"index.js",

"engines":{    
    "node":"8.1.1",
    "npm":"5.0.3"
  }

3) Specify start script

Instruct Heroku what command to run to start our server running

Syntax:

Insert just after "engines":{    
    "node":"8.1.1",
    "npm":"5.0.3"
  },

  "scripts": {
  "start": "node index.js" 
  },


  4) Create .gitignore file: We don't want to include dependencies,Heroku will
  do that for us
